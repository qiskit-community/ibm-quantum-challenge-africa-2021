This is can make the farm susceptible to disease and pests as the entire yield would be affected. In some instances, growing two different plants nearby each other will increase the yield of both, though sometimes it can decrease the yield. Intercropping is the process where different plants are chosen to _increase_ the yield. Push-Pull crops are pairs of plants that repel pests and attract pests respectively. Integrating them into a larger farm increases the yield of harvested food but with the cost of not necessarily being able to use the harvest of Push-Pull crops as part of the total yield.
