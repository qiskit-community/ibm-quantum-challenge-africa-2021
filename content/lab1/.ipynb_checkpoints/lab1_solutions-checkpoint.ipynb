Furthermore, you also need to determine how many hectares of each you should plant. The four crops you can plant are wheat, soybeans, maize, and a push-pull crop.

This is can make the farm susceptible to disease and pests as the entire yield would be affected. In some instances, growing two different plants nearby each other will increase the yield of both, though sometimes it can decrease the yield. Intercropping is the process where different plants are chosen to _increase_ the yield. Push-Pull crops are pairs of plants that repel pests and attract pests respectively.

In their general sense, they are NP-Hard; a class of problems that is difficult to solve using classical computational methods. In fact, the best classical method to solve these problems involves heuristics, a technique that finds an approximate solution. Quantum Computers have been shown to provide significant speed-up and better scaling for some heuristic problems.
